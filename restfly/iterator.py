class APIIterator:
    """
    The API iterator provides a scalable way to work through result sets of any
    size.  The iterator will walk through each page of data, returning one
    record at a time.  If it reaches the end of a page of records, then it will
    request the next page of information and then continue to return records
    from the next page (and the next, and the next) until the counter reaches
    the total number of records that the API has reported.

    Note that this Iterator is used as a base model for all of the iterators,
    and while the mechanics of each iterator may vary, they should all behave
    to the user in a similar manner.

    Attributes:
        _api (restfly.session.APISession):
            The APISession object that will be used for querying for the
            data.
        count (int):
            The current number of records that have been returned
        max_items (int):
            The maximum number of items to return before stopping iteration.
        max_pages (int):
            The maximum number of pages to request before throwing stopping
            iteration.
        num_pages (int):
            The number of pages that have been requested.
        page (list):
            The current page of data being walked through.  pages will be
            cycled through as the iterator requests more information from the
            API.
        page_count (int): The number of record returned from the current page.
        total (int):
            The total number of records that exist for the current request.
